Project status: not finished

WARNING: This project was created in a few days and definitely isn't perfect!
Also this works on most sites, but there are some exceptions!

**Chrome Extension to inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript any web-page.**
Inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript to your favorite web-pages.
Have the changes you make be saved and applied everytime you visit the specified website.

Better than 'inspect element' because It will stay after a reload :D


**How to install?**
Simple, Get it here: `chrome store link`

-Fun use cases:
    -Cheat simple games like the t-rex game.
    -Fool your friends by showing them something fake on a website.
    -Make your own dark-theme for any website.
    -Test a website you're working on.
    -Whatevery you can imagine, be creative :D
