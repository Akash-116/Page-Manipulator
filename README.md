# Page Manipulator.

Project status: not finished

WARNING: This project was created in a few days and definitely isn't perfect (yet :D)!
This works on most sites, but there are some exceptions!

**Chrome Extension to inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript any web-page.**
Inject HTML, CSS or JavaScript to your favorite web-pages.
Have the changes you make be saved and applied everytime you visit the specified website.

Better than 'inspect element' because It will stay after a reload :D


**How to install?**
Currently, since it is still work in progress, you have to load it as an unpacked extension.
If you don't know how to do this, here are the steps.
- Download all these files and put them in to a folder.
- Open your chrome browser and click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
- Go to: "More Tools" > "Extensions".
- Enable developer mode in the top right corner.
- Click "Load unpacked" in the top left corner and select the folder.
- Enjoy :D

This will soon be in the chrome extensions store.
for free, of course :D

**Functionalities**
- Have HTML, CSS and/or Javascript automatically added to all pages or the pages you specify.
- Run custom CSS **Before** the page is fully loaded so you won't see the origial page first.
- Inject Javascript on the go.
- Add/Remove/Change the HTML and CSS on the go.
- Right click on any element on a page to get the full CSS path.
- Automatically save and sync scripts you make.

- **Fun use cases**:
    - Cheat simple games like the t-rex game.
    - Fool your friends by showing them something fake on a website.
    - Make your own dark-theme for any website.
    - Test a website you're working on.
    - Whatevery you can imagine, be creative :D


**What I learned:**
- The process of making extensions.
- Basics of JavaScript.
- Chrome storage API.
